# JustSomeScripts
## Useful for Linux users (?)

Hi.
Im an IT-beginner who sometimes writes scripts, just for the sake of it. Most stuff in this repository has probably not even been tested yet, but you are free to use, modify and distribute everything you can find here as you wish, as long as its not for making profit or doing bad stuff.

# WARNING
Dont ever run a script you found on the internet without first checking what it ACTUALLY does.
Thanks.

## NEW
Get my installer.sh and pull all these projects from your commandline! installer.sh will be debugged and further improved soon...

### ProtocolZeroControl
Lets you set security questions for "sudo rm -rf /" - as many as you want.
