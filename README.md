# JustSomeScripts
## Useful for Linux users (?)

Hi.
Im an IT-beginner who sometimes writes scripts, just for the sake of it. Most stuff in this repository has probably not even been tested yet, but you are free to use, modify and distribute everything you can find here as you wish, as long as its not for making profit or doing bad stuff.

# WARNING
Dont ever run a script you found on the internet without first checking what it ACTUALLY does.
Thanks.

### Firefox

### Flatpak
Installs Flatpak, updates packages.

### InstallSetup

### ProtocolZeroControl
Lets you set security questions for "sudo rm -rf /" - as many as you want.  
-r for reactivating an existing ProtocolZero-script, -u to deactivate an existing ProtocolZero-script, -w for running thru a textbased wizard, no parameter to just create a new ProtocolZero (deletes the existing one).

### SysToFile
Prints some very basic system analysis to a txt file.

### Update

### CheckIPs

### USB
