# JustSomeScripts
## Useful for Linux users (?)

Hi.
Sometimes I write scripts, just for the sake of it. Most stuff in this repository has probably not even been tested yet, but you are free to use, modify and distribute everything you can find here as you wish, as long as its not for making profit or doing bad stuff.

# WARNING
Dont ever run a script you found on the internet without first checking what it ACTUALLY does.
Thanks.
